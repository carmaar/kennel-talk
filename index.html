        <h2>GOAL 1</h2>
        <span class="bold">
          Provide a streamline way for pet parents to communicate with their
          furbabies.
        </span>
        <span>
          Animals are fickle. We want to bring owners a quick way to record
          their pets conversation, allowing them to translate their pet's
          tantrums at the simple click of a button. That way, owners know
          exactly what's on their pet's mind when it matters most.
        </span>
        <h2>GOAL 2</h2>
        <span class="bold">
          Use newest AI technology to bring accurate translations to pet owners.
        </span>
        <span>
          Kennel Talk harnesses the power of AI technology to record, analyze,
          and decipher boofs, woofs and whines-- all in real time. Just press
          the "record" button and give the application a few seconds to process,
          and
          <em>voila!</em>
          Understanding has never been simpler.
        </span>
        <h2>GOAL 2</h2>
        <span class="bold">
          Encourage organization of previous recordings.
        </span>
        <span>
          All translations have the option of being saved. Once saved, the tape
          is filed away in the "previous recordings" folder, allowing the user
          to replay whenever necessary. Kennel Talk encourages familiarity in
          pet mannerisms. By recording, saving, and listening to specific pets
          sounds, an owner may be able to recall past sounds and have an idea of
          what their pet is communicating.
